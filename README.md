# Odin Landing Page

This is my completed landing page project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The goal was to build a landing page from scratch, applying all the HTML and CSS concepts I've learned so far.

## Project Overview

I successfully built a responsive landing page with a clean and simple design. I focused on structuring the HTML in a semantic way and using CSS to ensure the layout works well on all devices. The design is minimal but functional, highlighting key sections like the header, main content, informational blocks, testimonials, and a call to action.

## Key Features

- **Clean Structure**: The page is built using semantic HTML5 and well-organized CSS for readability and maintainability.
- **Custom Design**: All the styling was done with plain CSS, no frameworks involved, allowing me to practice core styling techniques.

## What I Learned

Throughout this project, I reinforced my understanding of:
- Semantic HTML structure
- Layouts using flex
- Responsive design techniques
- Basic version control with Git
