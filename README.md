# Odin Landing Page

This is my second project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), and I'm currently working on building a landing page completely from scratch. I'm using everything I've learned so far in the course, from basic HTML and CSS to responsive design concepts.

## What I'm Doing

I'm in the process of creating a landing page with plain HTML and CSS. My goal is to design a clean and simple page that works well on desktop. I'm not using any frameworks—just writing the code myself to really understand how everything works.

## Why I'm Building This

This project is helping me practice and reinforce the fundamentals of web development. It's been a great way to challenge myself and put into action the skills I’ve gained up until now. Each step brings me closer to feeling more confident as a web developer.

## What I'm Learning

- How to structure the page with semantic HTML
- Styling the layout using Flexbox and Grid
- Ensuring the page is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes
- Managing the project with Git for version control

## What's Next

As I continue to build, I'll be focusing on refining the design and ensuring everything works smoothly.
